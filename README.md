# Reiâ€™s dotfiles
## Requirements
Make sure that jRebel's jar file is located in: ~/dev/jrebel/jrebel.jar
## Installation
You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/dotfiles`) The bootstrapper script will copy the files to your home folder.
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.corp.pingidentity.com/rcolina/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source bootstrap.sh
```
